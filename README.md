# youtube-clone
This project involves creating a YouTube clone, a comprehensive video-sharing platform, using HTML, CSS, and Python. The collaboration between two developers, one focusing on the front end and the other on the back end, will result in a fully functional application that mimics the core features of YouTube. The front end will handle user interactions, video playback, and a responsive design, while the back end will manage video uploads, user authentication, and data storage. The project will be version-controlled through GitHub, allowing seamless collaboration, code reviews, and continuous integration. By dividing responsibilities and leveraging modern web development practices, this project aims to deliver a robust and scalable platform for video content creation and sharing.
